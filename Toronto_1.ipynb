For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, you will notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.\n",
    "- If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough. So for the 9th cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be Queen's Park.\n",
